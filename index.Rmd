## Overview

Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) represent a major public safety issue in New York City.

Using data from NYC Open Data, this project explores:

- When collisions occur  
- Where they occur  
- How severe they are  
- Which factors are associated with injuries and fatalities

This website presents descriptive analyses, spatial mapping, and statistical modeling results to better understand collision patterns and risk factors across the five boroughs.

## Data Source

This project uses the following dataset:

- **Dataset:** Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes  
- **Publisher:** New York City Police Department (NYPD)  
- **Source:** NYC Open Data  
- **Link:** https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95

Each row corresponds to a single crash and includes date, time, location, injuries, fatalities, vehicle types, and contributing factors.

More details are provided on the **About / Data** page.

## Research Questions

We focus on the following questions:

1. **When** do collisions most frequently occur?  
2. **Where** do collisions occur, and which boroughs are most affected?  
3. **How severe** are collisions?  
4. **Which factors** are associated with injuries?
