title: "Crashes and Causes: A Data-Driven Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City (2012–2024)"
output: github_document
---

## Motivation
Motor vehicle collisions are a leading cause of injury and death in urban environments. In New York City, hundreds of crashes are recorded every day, reflecting patterns in traffic volume, street design, driver behavior, and policy initiatives such as *Vision Zero*. By analyzing **when** and **where** crashes occur and **which factors** contribute to severe outcomes, this project aims to generate actionable insights for traffic safety and urban planning. Using the NYC Open Data dataset *“Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes”*, we will explore temporal, spatial, and causal patterns in collisions across New York City as well as indicators for injury, fatality, and grouped contributing factors.

## Initial Questions

We plan to focus on the following questions; these may evolve as our analysis progresses:

1. **Temporal trends** – How have crash counts and severity changed over time（2012-2014）？ Are there daily or seasonal patterns? 
2. **Spatial variation** – Which boroughs and neighborhoods have the highest crash rates? Where are “hot spots”?  
3. **Contributing factors** – What are the most common causes (e.g., inattention, speeding, alcohol)? How do they differ by time or vehicle type?  (e.g., private cars vs taxis vs bicycles)
4. **Policy evaluation (Vision Zero)** - Did the launch of NYC’s *Vision Zero* initiative in 2014 coincide with noticeable changes in crash counts and fatalities?  - Are trends in serious injury and fatal crashes different before and after 2014?

## Data

Our analysis uses the NYC Open Data *“Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes”* dataset, which contains detailed information on all reported traffic collisions in New York City since 2012. Each record includes the date and time of the crash (`CRASH_DATE`), the borough and location details (` BOROUGH`, ` ZIP_CODE`), the number of people injured or killed (` NUMBER_OF_PERSONS_INJURED`, `NUMBER_OF_PERSONS_KILLED`), and the contributing factors and vehicle types involved (` CONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_1`, ` VEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_1`). These variables allow us to examine temporal, spatial, and behavioral trends in crash risk and severity across the five NYC boroughs.

### Data cleaning and preprocessing (planned)

Since we have a large data set, we plan to restrict the main analysis to a recent time window (e.g., **2015–2024**) while keeping earlier years for trend checks. We will filter to observations with non-missing boroughs and valid coordinates.  We will create new variables for `year`, `month`, `weekday`, and `hour` from the crash date and time, along with indicators for injuries or fatalities and grouped categories of contributing factors (e.g., Driver Inattention, Unsafe Speed, Alcohol Involvement, Other).

## Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Time series plots of monthly crash counts and injury/fatality counts by borough.  
   - Distribution of crashes by hour of day and day of week.  
   - Top contributing factors overall and stratified by borough or time of day.  

2. **Spatial analysis**  
   - Map crash locations with spatial data.  
   - Aggregate to neighborhood or ZIP code for **crash density** visualizations.  

3. **Modeling (injury / fatality risk)**  
   - Build exploratory logistic regression models for:
     - probability of any injury, and/or  
     - probability of any fatality  
   - Predictors may include borough, hour of day, contributing factor categories, and vehicle type.  
   - Assess variable importance and model fit; interpret coefficients in a public-health context.
4. **Visualization and communication**  
   - Well-labeled, publication-quality figures created using `ggplot2`.  
   - Potential interactive elements (e.g., interactive maps or hover tooltips) on the project website.
   
Coding challenges we anticipate include:
- Efficiently handling a large dataset (memory and speed).  
- Working with date-time variables and combining `CRASH_DATE` and `CRASH_TIME`.  
- Cleaning and recoding free-text contributing factor variables into meaningful groups.  
- Integrating static and (optionally) interactive visualizations into a reproducible website.

## Intended Final Products
- **Written report (R Markdown → HTML)**  
  A self-contained document describing motivation, data, methods, results, and discussion.
- **Project website**  
  Built using R Markdown / Quarto and GitHub Pages, with:
  - Landing page summarizing motivation and main findings  
  - Detailed EDA and analysis pages  
  - Embedded full report
- **Screencast**  
  A narrated video that walks through our project for the audience.

- **GitHub repository**  
  Public repo containing:
  - `data/` (raw and cleaned data or scripts to download)  
  - `scripts/` (cleaning and analysis code)  
  - `report/` (Rmd + rendered HTML)  
  - `docs/` or `website/` (project website files)  

## Planned Timeline
- **Week 1 (Proposal + Setup):** Finalize questions and roles, set up GitHub repo, clean a subset of data.  
- **Week 2 (EDA + Visuals):** Summarize by borough, time, severity; make trend and heatmap plots.  
- **Week 3 (Spatial & Factor Analysis):** Map crash density, analyze contributing factors and vehicle types.  
- **Week 4 (Modeling + Draft):** Fit models for injury/fatality risk, draft report and integrate visuals.  
- **Week 5 (Polish + Website):** Finalize report and site, record screencast, check reproducibility.
